## Background and Motivation:

The idea of this project is to investigate how air traffic contributes to the increase the air pollution and how this may also affect global warming. We will try to utilize historical data for correlation and analysis, and real-time data with the aim to predict some measurements of the air pollutants that show the air quality such as the Ozone (O3), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), etc.
