# The-Air-Traffic-and-the-Air-Pollution
This project is to investigate how air traffic contributes to the increase the air pollution and how this may also affect global warming


## Background and Motivation:
Has been stated that the unforeseen outbreak due to COVID-19 in the 21st century, and the forced confinement of millions of inhabitants over the world, mainly during the first part of 2020, has shown a reduction in the temperature in the bigger capitals worldwide.

"Human activity is the cause of the climate problem."
António Guterres, COP27, Egypt, Nov. 2022

The idea of this project is to investigate how air traffic contributes to the increase the air pollution and how this may also affect global warming. We will try to utilize historical data for correlation and analysis, and real-time data with the aim to predict some measurements of the air pollutants that show the air quality such as the Ozone (O3), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), etc.
